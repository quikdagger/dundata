Dungeons and Data is an innovative take on classic old-school RPGs, fusing procedurally generated worlds with the beloved gameplay of fales similar in vein to the old Goldbox series. Players take on the roll of a guild leader, commanding a band of adventurers instead of a single protagonist or even single party composition. This reimagining allows for dynamic party compositions as classes level at different paces and require specialized training. This brings the old concept into play. If you are not tracking time accurately and precisely then you do not have a campaign, or to be more exacting: ““Game time is of utmost importance. Failure to keep careful track of time expenditure by player characters will result in many anomalies in the game. The stricture of time is what makes recovery of hit points meaningful. Likewise, the time spent adventuring in wilderness areas removes concerned characters from their bases of operations – be they rented chambers or battlemented strongholds. Certainly the most important time strictures pertain to the manufacturing of magic items, for during the period of such activity no adventuring can be done. Time is also considered in gaining levels and learning new languages and more. All of these demands upon game time force choices upon player characters and likewise number their days of game life…YOU CANNOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL CAMPAIGN IF STRICT TIME RECORDS ARE NOT KEPT.” (Gary Gygax-Dungeon Master’s Guide, page 37).

The entire game world is procedurally generated, from the neverending and sprawling overworld map to the dungeons, NPCs, and quests. Using robust solo RPG mechanics inspired by systems like Mythic GM Emulator, World’s Without Numbers, Ironsworn, and more, every aspect of the adventure emerges organically. Players must explore the land hex-by-hex, utilizing time-honored RPG rules from Old-School Essentials or OSRIC rulesets. There are no predetermined stories–the narrative unfolds based on the player’s choices and interactions.

What truly sets Dungeons and Data apart is its evolving, living world. Factions with their own motives and resources make moves periodically, altering the landscape. Players can ally with or oppose these factions, or risk ignoring them at their own peril. The world persists and changes based on these organic developments, ensuring no two playthroughs are ever the same. It’s a delicate balance of sandbox exploration and persistent consequences.
